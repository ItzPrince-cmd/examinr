Physics,Mechanics,Newton's Laws,Force and Motion,Multiple Choice,Medium,"A block of mass $m$ is placed on a frictionless inclined plane of angle $\theta$. What is the acceleration of the block?","$g\sin\theta$","$g\cos\theta$","$g\tan\theta$","$g$",A,"The component of gravitational force along the incline is $mg\sin\theta$. Using Newton's second law: $ma = mg\sin\theta$, therefore $a = g\sin\theta$","mechanics,incline,acceleration",,Yes,2022,JEE Main,,4,1,,
Mathematics,Calculus,Integration,Definite Integrals,Numerical,Hard,"Evaluate: $\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sin^2(x) dx$",,,,,,,"Using the identity $\sin^2(x) = \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}$, we get $\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2}[x - \frac{\sin(2x)}{2}]_{0}^{\pi/2} = \frac{\pi}{4}$","integration,trigonometry",,Yes,2021,JEE Advanced,,5,1.25,0.01,
Chemistry,Physical Chemistry,Thermodynamics,First Law,Multiple Correct,Medium,"Which of the following statements are correct for an isothermal process?","$\Delta U = 0$ for an ideal gas","$q = -w$ for a reversible process","$PV = constant$ for an ideal gas","Temperature increases continuously","A,B,C","In an isothermal process, temperature is constant. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature, so $\Delta U = 0$. From first law: $q = -w$. For ideal gas: $PV = nRT = constant$","thermodynamics,isothermal",,No,,,HC Verma,4,1,,
Biology,Cell Biology,Cell Structure,Organelles,True/False,Easy,"Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell",True,False,,,A,"Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration, which is the main energy currency of cells","cell biology,mitochondria",,No,,,,2,0.5,,
Mathematics,Algebra,Quadratic Equations,Roots,Fill in the Blank,Medium,"For the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of roots is ____",,,,,,"-b/a","By Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we have $\alpha + \beta = -b/a$","algebra,quadratic,vieta",,Yes,2020,Board,,3,1,,
