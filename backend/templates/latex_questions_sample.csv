"Find the value of $x$ in the equation: $2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$",mathematics,Algebra,"Quadratic Equations",medium,multiple_choice,"$x = \frac{1}{2}$ or $x = -3$","$x = 1$ or $x = -\frac{3}{2}$","$x = \frac{1}{2}$ or $x = 3$","$x = -\frac{1}{2}$ or $x = 3$",A,4,"Using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ where $a=2$, $b=5$, $c=-3$. This gives us $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4} = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}$. Therefore, $x = \frac{1}{2}$ or $x = -3$.","Apply the quadratic formula with the given coefficients.","quadratic,algebra,equations"
"Calculate the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 \sin(x)$",mathematics,Calculus,Differentiation,hard,short_answer,,,,,1,5,"Using the product rule: $f'(x) = (x^3)' \sin(x) + x^3 (\sin(x))' = 3x^2 \sin(x) + x^3 \cos(x)$","Remember to use the product rule: $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$","calculus,derivative,product-rule"
"A block of mass $m = 5$ kg is placed on a frictionless inclined plane at angle $\theta = 30°$. What is the acceleration of the block?",physics,Mechanics,"Newton's Laws",medium,numerical,,,,,1,4,"The component of gravity along the incline is $mg\sin\theta$. Using Newton's second law: $ma = mg\sin\theta$, so $a = g\sin\theta = 9.8 \times \sin(30°) = 9.8 \times 0.5 = 4.9$ m/s²","Draw a free body diagram and resolve forces parallel to the incline.","mechanics,forces,incline"
"Balance the following chemical equation: $\ce{Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3}$",chemistry,"Inorganic Chemistry","Chemical Reactions",easy,short_answer,,,,,1,3,"The balanced equation is: $\ce{4Fe + 3O2 -> 2Fe2O3}$. We need 4 iron atoms and 6 oxygen atoms on each side.","Count atoms on each side and adjust coefficients.","balancing,reactions,stoichiometry"
"Evaluate the integral: $\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) dx$",mathematics,Calculus,Integration,hard,multiple_choice,$\frac{\pi}{2}$,$\pi$,$\frac{\pi}{4}$,$2\pi$,A,5,"Using the identity $\sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}$, we get: $\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) dx = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2}[x - \frac{\sin(2x)}{2}]_0^{\pi} = \frac{1}{2}[\pi - 0] = \frac{\pi}{2}$","Use the power reduction formula for $\sin^2(x)$.","integration,trigonometry,definite-integral"
"The wave function of a particle is $\psi(x) = A e^{-\alpha x^2}$. Find the normalization constant $A$.",physics,"Quantum Mechanics","Wave Functions",expert,short_answer,,,,,1,6,"For normalization: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$. This gives us $|A|^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-2\alpha x^2} dx = 1$. Using the Gaussian integral formula, we get $|A|^2 \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\alpha}} = 1$, so $A = \left(\frac{2\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{1/4}$","Use the standard Gaussian integral: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ax^2} dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}$","quantum,normalization,gaussian"
