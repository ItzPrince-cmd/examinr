## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Question Bank Foundation

### Overview
The question bank is your golden goose - everything revolves around it. We'll build a robust system that can handle thousands of questions with LaTeX support, images, and categorization.

### Step 1.1: Setting Up Question Storage Infrastructure

**PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE:**
```
I need to implement a comprehensive question bank storage system for my Examinr platform. The question bank is the core of my entire application - both students and teachers depend on it.

   - Detailed solutions with step-by-step explanations
   - Performance analytics (how many times attempted, success rate)

2. Create a comprehensive question management API in backend/controllers/questionController.js with these endpoints:
   - POST /api/questions/create - Create single question
   - POST /api/questions/bulk-import - Import questions from CSV/Excel
   - GET /api/questions/search - Advanced search with filters
   - GET /api/questions/by-category - Get questions by subject/chapter/topic
